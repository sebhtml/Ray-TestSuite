# Environment variables

RAY_GIT_PATH
Where is your git clone. If not defined, the value is ~/git-clones/ray

NSLOTS
The number of compute cores to use per system test.
If not defined, it is 64 when using Sun Grid Engine or
the number of compute cores when using your computer (Symmetric MultiProcessing).

# Running system tests

data-for-system-tests is a symbolic link.

System tests are in the directory tests.

Executing main-sge.sh submit all system tests to a compute grid.

Then, main-sge.sh waits for everything to complete before returning.


Executing main-smp.sh runs system tests one after the other.



# system tests

In the tests directory, system tests are.

Each of them has a entry point called main.sh and symbolic links to data entries.


To run a single system test with Sun Grid Engine, use the command:

./run-test-sge.sh phix


To run a single system test directly on your computer, use the command

./run-test-smp.sh phix


To change the number of cores used, run this before:

export NSLOTS=256

# builds

Before running system tests, Ray builds are generated. They are deposited in builds.
